## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Noah, a full stack software engineer (and all around computer geek) who programs in a variety of languages and domains. I had taught myself to code since I was a young teenager and my first "real" programming language was Perl, which I picked up for programming chatbots of all things. Take a look around my GitHub page (and some linked organizations, below) to see what I've been up to.

Some of my open source personal projects are placed under some GitHub organizations I created to keep some related projects grouped together:

* [@aichaos](https://github.com/aichaos) houses most of my chatbot related projects
* [@SketchyMaze](https://github.com/SketchyMaze) hosts a mirror of repos for my videogame project

Some of my largest or most noteworthy projects are as follows:

## RiveScript (A chatbot scripting language)

RiveScript is a "scripting language" I designed for programming classic chatbots that use canned responses. The initial version of RiveScript was implemented in Perl and since then I had implemented it in a variety of other languages including Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go -- it made for a great project to learn the ropes with a new programming language, and each new port helped broaden the potential userbase of my project. The JavaScript and Python versions had been especially popular, collecting a lot of contributions and stars on GitHub, and I even witnessed a whole startup company (Run Dexter) pop up centered around my work!

* Language specification: [RiveScript Working Draft](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-wd)
* Implementations: [Python](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-python), [JavaScript](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js), [Go](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go), [Java](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-java), [Perl](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-perl)
* Test suite for implementations: [rsts](https://github.com/aichaos/rsts)

## Sketchy Maze (A drawing-based maze game)

Sketchy Maze is a "drawing-based maze game" themed around hand drawn maps on paper. You can draw your own level (freehand or with basic drawing tools) and make it look like anything you want, and drag and drop some "doodads" such as buttons, keys and enemies to make it interesting, and then play your level as a 2D side scrolling platformer game. Oh, and as for those doodads: you may also create your own and program them in JavaScript to do anything you want! This game is one part "Mario Maker but you can make anything you want" and another part "generic 2D platforming game engine" with a _lot_ of flexibility afforded by writing custom doodads and assets.

The game is a manifestation of my own childhood imagination: as a kid I used to draw my own mazes on pen & paper inspired by all the side scrolling platformer games that I grew up with (such as Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Bros.). While the game is themed around hand drawn maps on paper, the engine is actually quite flexible and you could port over full-color pixel art maps and program custom behaviors for your own doodads.
